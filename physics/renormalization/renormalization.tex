\section{Regulators}

There are two steps to a renormalization calculation: regulation and renormalization. Regulation is the process of deforming 
your QFT to give something formally finite and to give you a way to determine ``how infinite" a divergence is. After you 
have regulated your theory, you must renormalize it, in which you swap out the parameters in your Lagrangian for 
renormalized parameters.

\section{Local Operator Renormalization}

Renormalization of a theory is often seen as a program that replaces the bare couplings and fields in a Lagrangian by 
renormalized quantities to make the observable quantities we can compute from a theory finite in the UV or the IR. 
However, renormalization can be viewed from a much more general perspective in terms of local composite operators. 
A \textbf{local composite operator} is an operator $\mathcal O(x)$ which is built up from the fields and derivatives in a theory 
at a single spacetime point $x$. Schematically for a theory with fermion fields $\{\Psi_i(x)\}$ and a gauge field $A_\mu$, 
such an operator looks like:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal O_{\mu ...\nu \rho ... \sigma}(x) = \mathcal Z_{\mathcal O} D_{\mu}...D_{\nu} A_{\sigma} ... A_{\rho} 
	\Gamma_{\ell_1} ... \Gamma_{\ell_k} \Psi_{i_1} ... \Psi_{i_k} \overline \Psi_{j_1} ... \overline\Psi_{j_k}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal Z_{\mathcal O}$ is a normalization constant which we will use to renormalize the operator $\mathcal O$, 
and $\Gamma$ is any matrix with a Dirac structure. The operator can have any number of spin indices that one wants, but 
often we will consider a relatively small value for its spin because the operators which are dominant in the OPE 
are those with the smallest twist\footnote{The twist of an operator is its spin $s$ (number of Lorentz indices) minus the mass 
dimension $d$. Operators must have twist $\geq 2$, so we will often consider twist 2 operators.}. 

Even after renormalizing all the fields and couplings in the Lagrangian, matrix elements of composite operators are often 
divergent, which is why we need to renormalize them separately. Take for example the renormalization of the operator 
$\mathcal O := \phi^2$ in the $\phi^4$ scalar field theory. When we renormalize the bare field $\phi_0 = \mathcal Z_\phi(\mu)
\phi(\mu)$, this does not immediately renormalize $\mathcal O$. This is because as an operator, $\phi^2$ is implicitly the 
normal ordering $:\phi^2:$ of the actual $\phi^2$ operator. Because of this normal ordering, renormalization constants 
are not multiplicative\footnote{More on that here: https://www.physicsoverflow.org/27963/renormalization-determined-renormalization-elementary}, i.e. we cannot just take $\mathcal O = \mathcal Z(\mu)^2$. 

To renormalize a composite operator, it suffices to compute a (divergent) Green's function and impose renormalization 
conditions on that. Typically the renormalization condition on this Green's function will be setting it equal to its 
tree level value. 

When we study composite operator renormalization, we do not need to even insert the operator into the Lagrangian. Instead, 
we will view the operator $\mathcal O$ we wish to renormalize as an \textbf{external operator} which is separate from the 
theory's Lagrangian. The goal of renormalizing $\mathcal O$ is to make any Green's function of $\mathcal O$ with another 
operator finite, and we can do this without introducing a coupling. Later we will see what happens when we renormalize 
an external operator then add it to a Lagrangian; based on the operator renormalization, we will immediately be able 
to read off how its Wilson coefficient flows. 

For any of these computations, we will need to understand how to diagrammatically compute Green's functions. We can use 
what Schwartz calls \textbf{off-shell Feynman rules} to diagrammatically compute this Green's function. Off-shell Feynman 
rules are the same as the typical Feynman rules for a theory, with some extra caveats:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We replace external polarizations with propagators. Because of this, we will often want to consider amputated 
	Green's functions without the propagators as the objects to renormalize. 
	\item Current insertions have their own set of rules, and are taken at non-zero momenta. This means currents 
	inject momentum into our diagrams, and this must be considered when labeling all the momenta. 
	\item We do not always ``work backwards" from the tip of the arrow to its bottom when computing diagrams with 
	fermion lines (as we will see in the example). 
\end{itemize}

The main tool we will use to expand these diagrams in perturbation theory is the following relation between operators  in 
the interacting theory and operators in the free theory:
\begin{equation}
	\langle 0 | T\left\{\mathcal O_1(x_1) ...\mathcal O_n(x_n)\right\} | 0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\mathcal A}\langle 0 | 
	T\left\{\exp\left[i\int d^4z\, \mathcal L_{int}^0(z)\right] \mathcal O_1^0(x_1) ... \mathcal O_n^0(x_n))\right\} | 0\rangle~
	\label{eq:free_expansion}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal O^0$ denotes an operator in the free theory, and $\mathcal L_{int}^0$ is the interaction Lagrangian 
in the free theory. $\mathcal A$ is a normalization given by:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal A = \langle 0 | T \left\{\exp\left(i\int d^4 z\,\mathcal L_{int}^0(z)\right)\right\} | 0\rangle
\end{equation}
With this expansion, we can draw Feynman diagrams. Intuitively it helps to compare this to a derivation of Feynman 
diagrams in Schwartz, where he shows how to compute $n$-point functions diagrammatically using Equation 7.64 to 
relate them to their free field values:
\begin{equation}
	\langle 0 | T\left\{\phi(x_1) ... \phi(x_n)\right\} | 0\rangle = \frac{1}{\mathcal A} \langle 0 | T\left\{\exp\left[i\int d^4z\, \mathcal 
	L_{int}^0(z)\right]\phi^0(x_1) ... \phi^0(x_n)\right\} | 0\rangle
\end{equation}
The key point in this equation (as in Equation~\ref{eq:free_expansion}) is that we can Taylor expand the exponential and 
contract the fields on the right hand side of the equation to give ourselves propagators and derive Feynman rules for the 
theory. 

Once we renormalize an operator, an important quantity to compute is the operator's \textbf{anomalous dimension} 
$\gamma_\mathcal{O}$, which describes how the operator flows under renormalization:
\begin{equation}
	\gamma_\mathcal{O} := -\frac{\mu}{Z_\mathcal{O}}\frac{d \mathcal{Z_{\mathcal O}}}{d\mu} = -\mu\frac{d}{d\mu}\log
	\mathcal Z_\mathcal{O}
\end{equation}
Once we have determined the counterterm for the operator $\mathcal{Z_\mathcal{O}}$, we can immediately get the anomalous 
dimension. This quantity acts similarly to the $\beta$ function for a coupling, and also appears in the Callan-Symanzik 
equation on equal terms. 

TODO discuss Callan-Symanzik.

\subsection{Example: QED current}

We will do an example in QED, and compute the renormalization of $j^\mu(x) = \overline \psi(x)\gamma^\mu \psi(x)$. 
The simplest non-vanishing Green's function involving $j^\mu(x)$ is the three point function, which we will expand 
in momentum space:
\begin{equation}
	\langle j^\mu(x) \psi(x_1) \overline\psi(x_2)\rangle = \int \dbar^4 p\,\dbar^4 q_1\,\dbar^4 q_2\, e^{-ipx}e^{-ip_1 x_1}
	e^{iq_2x_2} i\mathcal M^\mu(p, q_1, q_2) (2\pi)^4 \delta^4(p + q_1 - q_2)
\end{equation}
We have chosen the signs on the momenta to replicate a current insertion of momentum $p$; namely, if a particle is 
propagating initially with momentum $q_1$, the current insertion knocks the momentum of the particle so that:
\begin{equation}
	q_2 = p + q_1
\end{equation}

We will compute this in perturbation theory to one loop and associate a diagram with each term. Using the expansion in 
Equation~\ref{eq:free_expansion}, we can expand the exponential to one loop:
\begin{equation}
	\exp\left(i\int d^4z\,\mathcal L_{int}^0(z)\right) \sim 1 + i\int d^4 z\, \mathcal L_{int}^0 + \frac{i^2}{2} \int d^4 z\, d^4 z'\, 
	\mathcal L_{int}^0(z) \mathcal L_{int}^0(z') + ...
\end{equation}
When inserted into the equation, the first piece gives the tree level vertex and the piece with two integrals gives the first 
loop correction. Plugging in at first order, we can use Wick's theorem to evaluate the free field correlators (here $\alpha, 
\beta, \rho, \sigma$ are Dirac indices):
\begin{align}
	\langle j^\mu(x) \psi(x_1) \overline\psi(x_2)\rangle_\textnormal{tree} &= \langle j^\mu_0(x) \psi_0(x_1) 
	\overline\psi_0(x_2)\rangle \\
	&= \langle \wick{
		\c1{\overline\psi_0^\alpha}(x) \gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \c2{\psi_0^\beta}(x) \c1{\psi_0^\rho}(x_1) 
		\c2{\overline \psi_0^\sigma}(x_2) 
	}\rangle \\ 
	&= S(x_1, x) \gamma^\mu S(x, x_2)
\end{align}
as $\langle \psi(x) \overline \psi(y)\rangle = S(x, y) = i\int \dbar^4 k\,\frac{e^{-ik(x - y)}}{\slashed{k} - m}$. We can take this tree 
level result to momentum space, where we see:
\begin{align}
	\mathcal M^\mu(p, q_1, q_2)_\textnormal{tree} &= \int d^4 x\,d^4 x_1\, d^4x_2\, e^{ipx}e^{iq_1 x_1} e^{-iq_2 x_2} \langle 
	j^\mu(x) \psi(x_1)\overline\psi(x_2)\rangle_{tree} \nonumber \\
	&= \int d^4 x\,d^4 x_1\, d^4x_2\, e^{ipx}e^{iq_1 x_1} e^{-iq_2 x_2} \int \dbar^4 k\, \int \dbar^4 k'\, 
	\frac{ie^{-ik(x_1 - x)}}{\slashed{k} - m} \gamma^\mu \frac{ie^{-ik'(x - x_2)}}{\slashed{k'} - m} \nonumber \\
	&= \int\dbar^4 k\,\dbar^4 k'\, d^4 x\, d^4 x_1\,d^4 x_2 e^{i(p + k - k')x}e^{i(q_1 - k)x_1}e^{i(k' - q_2)x_2} 
	\frac{i}{\slashed k - m}\gamma^\mu\frac{i}{\slashed k' - m} \nonumber\\
	&= \frac{i}{\slashed q_1 - m} \gamma^\mu\frac{i}{\slashed q_2 - m}\delta^4(p + q_1 - q_2)
\end{align}
where we leave the delta function in to emphasize that we \textbf{must enforce momentum conservation from current 
insertion}. Diagrammatically, this corresponds to the diagram
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\feynmandiagram [large, horizontal'=a to c] {
%a [particle = \(q_1\)] -- [insertion = {[size = 6pt, style = red] .5}] c [particle = \(q_2\)]
a [particle = \(q_1\)] -- [fermion] b [dot, style = red],
b -- [fermion] c [particle = \(q_2\)]
};
\end{gathered}~
\label{eq:current_insertion}
\end{equation}
where the red dot denotes a current insertion of momentum $p$. 

Now we move towards the actual process of renormalization: we can expand Equation~\ref{eq:free_expansion} to 
one loop and compute the one loop 1PI correction, then renormalize the operator. This is going to get very tiring very soon, 
but I think it is instructive to get familiar with where the Feynman rules come from for operator insertions. At one 
loop, we pick up the $(\mathcal L_{int}^0)^2$ piece in our free theory Green's function (recall $\mathcal L_{int}^0(z) = 
-e\overline\psi_0(z) \slashed A^0(z) \psi_0(z)$). This gives us (also switching the Dirac indices to be Latin indices because 
there are a lot of them and I don't know the entire Greek alphabet):
\begin{align}
	\langle j^\mu(x) \psi^a(x_1)\overline \psi^b(x_2)\rangle_\textnormal{1-loop} = -\frac{e^2}{2}\int d^4z\, d^4z'\,\langle 
	\overline\psi_0^c(z) 
	&\gamma^\nu_{cd} A_\nu^0(z) \psi_0^d(z)
	\times\nonumber \\
	\overline\psi_0^e(z')\gamma^\lambda_{ef} A_\lambda^0(z')\psi_0^f(z')
	&\overline\psi_0^g(x) \gamma_{gh}^\mu \psi_0^h(x) \psi_0^a (x_1) \overline \psi_0^b(x_2)\rangle 
\end{align}
We now have to sum on all contractions of each of the fields. However, we can simplify this by remembering that we are only 
dealing with connected, 1PI diagrams and throw away many of the contractions. Namely, the general structure of the correlator 
will look like this:
\begin{equation}
	\langle j^\mu(x) \psi^a(x_1)\overline \psi^b(x_2)\rangle_\textnormal{1-loop}\sim \frac{(-ie)^2}{2}\int \langle A(z) A(z')\rangle 
	\langle \overline\psi(z) \psi(z) \overline\psi(z') \psi(z') \overline\psi(x)\psi(x) \overline\psi(x_1)\psi(x_2)\rangle
	\nonumber
\end{equation}
where we sum over contractions for the fermionic correlator. Because the photon propagator $S^{(\gamma)}_{\nu\lambda}(z, 
z') = \langle A_\nu^0(z) A_\lambda^0(z')\rangle$ already connects the $z$ and $z'$ points, this limits the structure of this to 
two specific contractions:
\begin{equation}
	\langle j^\mu(x) \psi^a(x_1)\overline \psi^b(x_2)\rangle_\textnormal{1-loop} \sim\frac{(-ie)^2}{2}\int S^{(\gamma)}_{z, z'}
	\left[
	\langle \wick{
	\c1{\overline \psi_z} \c2{\psi_z} \c3{\overline\psi_{z'}}  \c4{\psi_{z'}} \c2{\overline\psi_x} \c3{\psi_x} \c1{\psi_{x_1}}
	\c4{\overline\psi_{x_2} }
	}\rangle + \langle \wick{
	\c1{\overline \psi_z} \c2{\psi_z} \c3{\overline\psi_{z'}}  \c4{\psi_{z'}} \c4{\overline\psi_x} \c1{\psi_x} \c3{\psi_{x_1}} 
	\c2{\overline\psi_{x_2}}
	} \rangle \right]
	\nonumber
\end{equation}
Diagrammatically, two diagrams which contribute look like this:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\feynmandiagram [small, horizontal'=a to b] {
a [particle = \(z\)] -- [boson] b [particle = \(z'\)],
c [particle = \(x\)] -- a,
c -- b,
d [particle = \(x_1\)] -- a,
e [particle = \(x_2\)] -- b
};
\end{gathered}~
\label{eq:1pi}
\end{equation}
where the second term has the $z$ and $z'$ vertices flipped. These will end up being the same and canceling the factor of 1/2. 

We only get these two contractions for a few reasons. 
First, because of the photon propagator connecting $z$ and $z'$, we cannot contract the fermion fields at $z$ and $z'$ 
together. If we did, we would get a graph which is not 1P1, because we could cut the bubble out of the diagram. Second, 
we cannot contract the $x_1$ and $x_2$ points together, or else we would have a disconnected diagram, hence we must 
contract $x_1$ and $x_2$ to one of $z$ or $z'$ (therefore we have two diagrams). This is easiest to see pictorially-- in the 
manner of the previous diagram. 

So, we have reduced this computation to calculating (now restoring the Dirac structure):
\begin{align}
	\langle j^\mu(x) \psi^a(x_1)\overline \psi^b(x_2)\rangle_\textnormal{1-loop} &= (-ie)^2 \int d^4z\,d^4z' S^{(\gamma)}_{\nu 
	\lambda}(z, z') \langle \wick{
	\c1{\overline \psi_z^c} \gamma^\nu_{cd} \c2{\psi_z^d} \c3{\overline\psi^e_{z'}} \gamma^\lambda_{ef} \c4{\psi_{z'}^f} 
	\c2{\overline\psi_x^g} \gamma^\mu_{gh} \c3{\psi_x^h} \c1{\psi_{x_1}^a}
	\c4{\overline\psi_{x_2}^b}
	}\rangle \nonumber \\
	&= (-ie)^2 \int d^4 z\, d^4 z' S^{(\gamma)}_{\nu\lambda}(z, z') S^{ac}(x_1, z) \gamma^\nu_{cd} S^{dg}(z, x) 
	\gamma^\lambda_{ef}S^{he}(x, z') \gamma_{gh}^\mu S_{fb}(z', x_2) \nonumber \\
	&= (-ie)^2 \int d^4 z \int d^4 z' S_{\nu\lambda}^{(\gamma)}(z, z') S(x_1, z)\gamma^\nu S(z, x) \gamma^\mu S(x, z') 
	\gamma^\lambda S(z', x_2)
\end{align}
where:
\begin{equation}
	S^{(\gamma)}_{\mu\nu}(x, y) = \int d^4k\frac{-ie^{ik(x - y)}g_{\mu\nu}}{k^2 + i\epsilon}
\end{equation}
is the photon propagator. We can now plug this into our expression for $\mathcal M^\mu(p, q_1, q_2)$ and associate a 
one-loop diagram to this computation (where the measure $d^{20}x = d^4x\,d^4x_1\,d^4 x_2\,d^4z\,d^4z'$):
\begin{align}
	\mathcal M^\mu&(p, q_1, q_2)_\textnormal{1-loop} = (-ie)^2\int d^{20} x\,e^{i(px + q_1 x_1 - q_2 x_2)} 
	S_{\nu\lambda}^{(\gamma)}(z, z') S(x_1, z)\gamma^\nu S(z, x) \gamma^\mu S(x, z') \gamma^\lambda S(z', x_2) 
	\nonumber \\
	&= (-ie)^2 \int d^{20}x \dbar^{20}k\, e^{i(px + q_1 x_1 - q_2 x_2)}\frac{-ie^{ik(z - z')}}{k^2}
	\frac{ie^{-ik_1(x_1 - z)}}{\slashed k_1 - m}\gamma^\nu \frac{ie^{-ik_2(z - x)}}{\slashed k_2 - m} \gamma^\mu \frac{ie^{-ik_3 
	(x - z')}}{\slashed k_3 - m} \gamma_\nu \frac{ie^{-ik_4 (z' - x_2)}}{\slashed k_4 - m} \nonumber \\
	&= (-ie)^2 \int d^{20}x \dbar^{20} k\, e^{i(p + k_2 - k_3)x}e^{i(k + k_1 - k_2)z} e^{i(k_3 - k_4 - k)z'}e^{i(q_1 - k_1)x_1}
	e^{-i(q_2 - k_4)x_2} \times \nonumber \\
	&\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \left(\frac{-i}{k^2} \frac{i}{\slashed k_1 - m} \gamma^\nu \frac{i}{\slashed k_2 - m}
	\gamma^\mu\frac{i}{\slashed k_3 - m} \gamma_\nu \frac{i}{\slashed k_4 - m}\right) \nonumber \\
	&= (-ie)^2 \frac{i}{\slashed q_1 - m}\left[\int\dbar^4 k \frac{i}{k^2}\gamma^\nu \frac{i}{\slashed q_1 + \slashed k - m}
	\gamma^\mu \frac{i}{\slashed q_2 + \slashed k - m}\gamma_\nu\right]\frac{i}{\slashed q_2 - m}
\end{align}
The delta functions enforce momentum conservation at each vertex in the following diagram, and we can thus 
encode this amplitude using the off-shell Feynman rules on the following diagram, where the current insertion 
injects momentum $p$ into the diagram, as well as a $\gamma^\mu$ factor. Our result is thus:
\begin{align}
	i\mathcal M^\mu(p, q_1, q_2)_\textnormal{1-loop} &= \begin{gathered}
	\feynmandiagram[large, horizontal' = a to b] {
	a -- [boson, reversed momentum' = \(k\)]b,
	%a -- [fermion, half left, momentum = \(k + q_1\), insertion = {[size = 6pt, style = red] .5}] b,
	a -- [fermion, momentum = \(q_1 + k\)] e [dot, style = red],
	e -- [fermion, momentum = \(q_2 + k\)] b,
	c -- [fermion, momentum = \(q_1\)] a,
	b -- [fermion, momentum = \(q_2\)] d 
	};
	\end{gathered} \\
	&= (-ie)^2 \frac{i}{\slashed q_1 - m}\left[\int\dbar^4 k \frac{i}{k^2}\gamma^\nu \frac{i}{\slashed q_1 + \slashed k - m}
	\gamma^\mu \frac{i}{\slashed q_2 + \slashed k - m}\gamma_\nu\right]\frac{i}{\slashed q_2 - m}
\end{align}
where $q_2 = p + q_1$ is the result of current insertion at the red dot in the diagram. At this point, we can evaluate this loop 
integral in dimensional regularization. Stripping off the mass dimensions of the electron coupling with 
$e\mapsto \mu^{\epsilon}e$ in $d = 4 - \epsilon$ dimensions, we have:
\begin{equation}
	i\mathcal M^\mu(p, q_1, q_2) = i\mathcal M^\mu_\textnormal{tree}(p, q_1, q_2) \frac{e^2}{16\pi^2}\frac{2}{\epsilon}
\end{equation}

To finish our renormalization process, we must include the counterterm diagram as well by expanding $\mathcal Z_j = 1 + 
\delta_j$ in the Green's function. We have:
\begin{align}
	\delta_j \mathcal M^\mu(p, q_1, q_2) &= 
	\begin{gathered}
        \feynmandiagram [large, horizontal'=a to c] {
        a [particle = \(q_1\)] -- [fermion] b [crossed dot, style = red],
b -- [fermion] c [particle = \(q_2\)]
};
\end{gathered} \\
&= i\mathcal M^\mu_\textnormal{tree}(p, q_1, q_2) \delta_j
\end{align}
where the red $\otimes$ denotes a counterterm insertion. We can thus read off the counterterm:
\begin{equation}
	\delta_j = -\frac{e^2}{16\pi^2}\frac{2}{\epsilon}
\end{equation}

Now that we have read off the counterterm, the bulk of the work is done! Notice that this calculation is much easier to do 
diagrammatically with Feynman rules than from first principles; however, I wanted to illustrate how to do build up and 
motivate Feynman rules for operator insertions, i.e. the off-shell Feynman rules that Schwartz discusses. Note that in 
this case, we read the fermion arrow from backwards to forwards because of the position of the propagators. In general, 
I would suggest doing Wick contractions at tree level first to determine the order of the propagators in the diagram, and then 
using this to move to the loop diagrams. 

To compute the anomalous dimension, the bare current can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
	J_{bare}^\mu = \overline\psi_0\gamma^\mu\psi_0 = \mathcal Z_J^{-1}\mathcal Z_\psi J_R^\mu
\end{equation}
where $\psi_0$ is the bare field. Since this is purely a function of the bare parameters, it cannot run with $\mu$. Using 
$\mathcal Z_J = \mathcal Z_\psi$, we can differentiate this to find:
\begin{equation}
	\mu \frac{dJ^\mu}{d\mu} = 0
\end{equation}
where $J^\mu$ is the renormalized current.
